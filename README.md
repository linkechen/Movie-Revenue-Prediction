# Movie-Revenue-Prediction
## Introduction
This project aims to predict movie box office revenue using features such as budget, genres, language, popularity, runtime, vote average, and vote count. The main goals are to:
1. Identify the feature with the strongest correlation to revenue, uncovering key drivers of financial success in the film industry.
2. Evaluate and compare the performance of multiple machine learning classifiers in predicting movie revenue, to find the most effective predictive model.
3. Determine optimal hyperparameters for the chosen classifiers to enhance model accuracy in forecasting revenues.

These objectives are designed to provide actionable insights for filmmakers, production companies, and investors, guiding decision-making to potentially increase the profitability of future movie projects. The project's findings aim to contribute valuable knowledge to the field of film industry analysis.
